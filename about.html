  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi there! I'm Shivani Jha, a proud alumna of Kendriya Vidyalaya, where I recently completed my 12th grade. 
    My educational journey at KV has been an enriching experience, filled with academic challenges, personal growth,
     and unforgettable memories.<br />

    As a student in the vibrant and inclusive Kendriya Vidyalaya community, I've had the opportunity to engage with a diverse group of peers and dedicated educators who have played a crucial role in shaping my 
    academic interests and values. Whether it was participating in various school events, representing my class
    , or collaborating on projects, Kendriya Vidyalaya has been the cornerstone of my formative years.<br />
    
    Beyond the classroom, I've been actively involved in ART activities , honing skills that go beyond t
    extbooks and contributing to the overall school environment. Kendriya Vidyalaya's commitment to holistic
     education has provided me with a well-rounded foundation for my future endeavors.<br />
    
    Now, as I move on from Kendriya Vidyalaya, I am excited about the new chapter ahead. I'm grateful 
    for the support and guidance I've received, and I carry with me the values instilled by my alma mater. 
    Looking forward to the next adventure and the opportunities that await as I continue my educational journey!</p><hr />
  
  <p>currently, a passionate and dedicated student at IGDTUW. 
     pursuing Btech in this dynamic and empowering academic environment. As a woman in technology, 
    I find IGDTUW to be the perfect place to nurture my curiosity and explore the endless possibilities that the field has to offer.

    Beyond academics, I'm actively involved in SOCh[The art society of IGDTUW]on campus, 
    where I get to collaborate with like-minded peers and contribute to exciting projects.
     IGDTUW's commitment to fostering a supportive community has allowed me to thrive both personally and academically.
    
    In my free time, you'll likely find me learning new skills, making new connections ,
     whether it's delving into the latest tech trends, participating in hackathons, 
     or simply enjoying some downtime with a good book. I believe in the power of education to transform lives, 
     and IGDTUW provides the perfect platform for me to grow, learn, and make a positive impact.
    
    Looking forward to the adventures that each day at IGDTUW brings and the incredible
     journey of self-discovery that comes with being a part of this vibrant academic community!</p><hr />
  
  <p>In this phase of life, I am working and trying to become the best possible version of myself, be it by learning new skills, 
    adapting lifestyle changes and what not!</p><hr />
